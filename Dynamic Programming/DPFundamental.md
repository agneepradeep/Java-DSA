# Dynamic Programming

_Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it._
â€” George Santayana

> **Dynamic Programming** is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computation. This approach is particularly useful for problems that have overlapping subproblems or that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

> **Note** - Work only if the sub-problems are _overlapping_ in nature.

## Approaches to Dyanmic Programming
1. **Bottom-Up**: Start with the smallest subproblem and build up to the final solution. (Iterative Approach)
2. **Top-Down**: Start with the final problem and break it down into smaller subproblems. (Recursive Approach)
