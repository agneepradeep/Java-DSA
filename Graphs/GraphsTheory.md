## Classification of Graphs
* **Directed Graphs** - Traversal is done in one direction

* **Undirected Graphs** - Traversal is done in both directions
* **Weighted Graphs** - Each edge has a weight associated with it
* **Unweighted Graphs** - Each edge has no weight associated with it
* **Cyclic Graphs** - Graph has a cycle'
    *  **Undirected Cyclic Graphs** - Graph has a cycle and is undirected

    *  **Directed Cyclic Graphs** - Graph has a cycle and is directed
* **Acyclic Graphs** - Graph has no cycle
    * **Undirected Acyclic Graphs** - Graph has no cycle and is undirected
    
    * **Directed Acyclic Graphs** - Graph has no cycle and is directed
